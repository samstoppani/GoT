      <h1 id="title">Game of Thrones</h1>
       <p>Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of
         A Song of Ice and Fire, set in the fictional
         Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos.
         The series chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among
         the realm's noble families for the Iron Throne, while other
         families fight for independence from it. It opens with additional
         threats in the icy North and Essos in the east.</p>

        <h2>The Great Houses</h2>
        <p> The Great Houses are the most powerful of the noble houses of the
          Seven Kingdoms. They exercise immense authority and power over their
          vassals and territories and are answerable only to the King of the
          Andals and the First Men.

          Before the Targaryen Conquest, each of the Seven Kingdoms was
          ruled independently by a powerful royal family. During the Conquest
          these families were either destroyed, replaced, or defeated and made
          to swear allegiance to King Aegon, who reigned from the
          Iron Throne in King's Landing. </p>

              <h3>House Baratheon</h3>
              <p>Rulers of the Stormlands from the castle of Storm's End.
                The former royal house of the Seven Kingdoms after Robert's Rebellion.
                The bloodline went extinct after Stannis Baratheon was killed at the Battle
                of Winterfell. Legally went extinct when King Tommen Baratheon killed himself
                in King's Landing after the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. Restored
                when Queen Daenerys Targaryen legitimized Robert's unacknowledged bastard son
                Gendry Baratheon.

                However, following the Battle of King's Landing, and with Euron's death at the
                hands of Ser Jaime Lannister, Yara is now the head of the house.

                Sept of Baelor until the Battle of King's Landing. Its leadership was disputed
                by Queen Cersei I Lannister and Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen, Lord
                Tyrion Lannister, who became the head of House Lannister after the Battle of
